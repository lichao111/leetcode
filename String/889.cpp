Input: Input: S = S = "cba""cba", K =1
 Output: Output: "acb""acb"
 Explanation: Explanatio 
In the first move, we move the 1st character ("c") to the end, obtaining the string "bac".
In the second move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the final result "acb".
Example 2:

Input: S = "baaca", K = 3
Output: "aaabc"
Explanation: 
In the first move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the string "aacab".
